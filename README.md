# starter-node-bot

## Overview
A simple starting point for creating and understanding a Node.js-based Slack bot that leverages the Slapp library!

## Assumptions
* You have already signed up with [Beep Boop](https://beepboophq.com) and have a local fork of this project.
* You have sufficient rights in your Slack team to configure a bot and generate/access a Slack API token.

## Configure Slapp Bot
Visit [Beep Boop](https://beepboophq.com/docs/article/getting-started) to get an overview of how to setup and configure a Slapp app.
Note that this starter-bot differs slightly in that it is not necessary to integrate 'Slash Commands'.

Starting with the section 'step #2' in the getting-started guide, you will be able to get this simple Slapp bot configured with Slack.

Once you get everything configured and the bot has been successfully built and is running (within BeepBoop) you should then
add it to your Slack team for testing. Type in the message "help" to see what "messages" this bot responds to.

For a further dive, look at the server.js code to see how this NodeJS-based bot programmatically "responds" to various messages

Happy Slapp'ing!
